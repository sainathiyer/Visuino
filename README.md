# Visuino
Controlling Servo Motor using Visuino

The components found in the Visuino software represent their hardware components and you will easily be able to create and design your programs using drag and drop. No equipment or hardware is needed to run the software in design mode. Once you have completed the design, you can connect Arduino board upload and run it.

For those people who are not strong on writing code then designing, compiling and creating Arduino programs has never been easier! Why waste time on creating code when we have done all the hard work for you already? You have your Arduino board, and great hardware design, see it running in minutes, not hours!

Visuino is the latest innovative software from Mitov Software. A visual programming environment allowing you to program your Arduino boards. It currently supports the official Arduino boards, Teensy, Femto IO, ESP8266, ESP32, Controllino, Goldilocks Analogue, FreeSoC2, chipKIT, Maple Mini, and number of Arduino clones, however it is not restricted to their support alone and requests to support new hardware are welcome.
